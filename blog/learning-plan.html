      <h2>My Strengths and Limitations</h2>

      <p>
        In 2021, I have completed some programming courses at Massey U and having done so gives me much confidence that I have what it takes to see the bootcamp through and realise my long term goal of becoming a web developer. Apart from the occassional moments of madness (metaphorically!), I have the ability to manage my time well and prioritise what needs to be done and when. I love solving puzzles and pride myself on my integrity, consistency and reliability.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the things I struggle with is asking for help. When I am faced with a problem, I strive to search for the solution and at times unknowingly fall into a rabbit hole. Toggl Track has been a very useful tool for me so far reminding me when I’ve spent too much time on something and it’s time to move on. It’s a work in progress still and I understand that it’s not just time that I’m wasting but also the opportunity to collaborate with my fellow learners – the answer might be just around the corner and all I have to do is ask, at the same time I might have the answer and all I have to do is speak up. I’d like to build the confidence to express myself and collaborate, to be able to ask questions and help out other learners.
      </p>
      
      <h2>My Commitment</h2>

      <p>
        I’m currently working part-time but just for the duration of Foundations – I’m finding this to be a bit of a challenge! I will move to full-time study when the bootcamp kicks in though and I’m really looking forward to that. My husband and 17 year-old daughter have always been and will always will be there to support me, I could not ask for more. The three of us have a lot going individually and have somehow (in our own way) nailed household chores like clockwork without neglecting the need to celebrate each one’s mini wins every now and again. I also believe in looking after oneself holistically as well – mind and body. I’ve started a running programme four months ago and would very much like to keep it going. There are three runs a week and time spent (about an hour or two each run) on training works well with the bootcamp and helps relax and reset the mind.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Cheers to the Facilitation Team!</h2>

      <p>
        It’s been two weeks and the Facilitation Team have been awesome. I appreciate their understanding and relentless support. I love the way the bootcamp has been structured and can see the importance of having to work through both the tech and core aspects of the program. Ultimately, I am responsible for what I achieve and my expectation of the team is simple – to keep up their good work!
