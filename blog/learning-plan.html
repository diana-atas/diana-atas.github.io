      <h2>Bootcamp</h2>
      <p>

        Nervous - the one word that sums up how I'm feeling about the upcoming Bootcamp. My husband then shared this with me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SUTInEaQ3Q">Nervous vs. Excited</a> - by Simon Sinek… briliiant! Okay, let's try that again… I am optimistic that I can power through Bootcamp and get it done. This is exciting!
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout Foundations, I have been in search of opportunities to collaborate with other learners but there have not been many or so I thought and mainly it was because I had a bit of difficulty trying to express my thoughts in chat in Discord. I am looking forward to be able to do this more often considering my Bootcamp will be held in person and with the assumption that it just might be easier to do so face to face - if I can overcome my shyness that is. This I believe will be my greatest challenge - public speaking and by public I mean more than one person! I would really love to better communicate my thoughts and develop the art of giving and receiving constructive feedback.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some good things are happening during the review period - it's my last week at work and we would have moved houses so that means more time for me to focus on Bootcamp woot! Family-wise, I'm a proud of my family - they have been awesome during Foundations and are excited for me - my husband's planning what he can do for dinner, my daughter's checking if we can catch the same bus to and from school (she goes to Whitecliffe) - I always say this but I could not ask for more. I need to figure out the commute as well as incorporating my running programme into my schedule from a new home address. I'm sure that once I get into the groove, I'll be golden. But that's just me and the Bootcamp is definitely not just about me, it's also about being part of the Dev Academy family. I may not be a genius in programming but I think every bit of help counts and I have every intention to do so, whether it's helping my peers spot the missing curly bracket or just being their “rubber ducky”.
      </p>

      <p>
        Figuring out how and when to do stuff is one thing, carrying it out is another. I can see challenges bigger than <code>javascript-carnival</code> are coming; I imagine a million rabbit holes to dive into. And with everybody else being busy with their own thing, I'm releived to know that there will be regular 1:1 check-ins and tech-ins. There are times where I know I have completed the challenge but it's not clear to me whether what I've done is the correct or ideal way, so it would be great to be reminded that I'm on the right track or if I need to be pulled back to the right track.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having worked in the insurance industry for almost 15 years, it just makes sense to jump into the same pool as soon as I graduate however being equipped with transferrable and sought-after skills the opportunities are endless! My husband and daughter work in retail and I feel like I'm drawn to that direction. It could be an interesting change - to work with tangible products. Wherever it may be, I can't wait to kickstart my career in the tech world.

      <h2>My Strengths and Limitations</h2>

      <p>
        In 2021, I have completed some programming courses at Massey U and having done so gives me much confidence that I have what it takes to see the bootcamp through and realise my long term goal of becoming a web developer. Apart from the occassional moments of madness (metaphorically!), I have the ability to manage my time well and prioritise what needs to be done and when. I love solving puzzles and pride myself on my integrity, consistency and reliability.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the things I struggle with is asking for help. When I am faced with a problem, I strive to search for the solution and at times unknowingly fall into a rabbit hole. Toggl Track has been a very useful tool for me so far reminding me when I’ve spent too much time on something and it’s time to move on. It’s a work in progress still and I understand that it’s not just time that I’m wasting but also the opportunity to collaborate with my fellow learners – the answer might be just around the corner and all I have to do is ask, at the same time I might have the answer and all I have to do is speak up. I’d like to build the confidence to express myself and collaborate, to be able to ask questions and help out other learners.
      </p>
      
      <h2>My Commitment</h2>

      <p>
        I’m currently working part-time but just for the duration of Foundations – I’m finding this to be a bit of a challenge! I will move to full-time study when the bootcamp kicks in though and I’m really looking forward to that. My husband and 17 year-old daughter have always been and will always will be there to support me, I could not ask for more. The three of us have a lot going individually and have somehow (in our own way) nailed household chores like clockwork without neglecting the need to celebrate each one’s mini wins every now and again. I also believe in looking after oneself holistically as well – mind and body. I’ve started a running programme four months ago and would very much like to keep it going. There are three runs a week and time spent (about an hour or two each run) on training works well with the bootcamp and helps relax and reset the mind.

      <h2>Cheers to the Facilitation Team!</h2>

      <p>
        It’s been two weeks and the Facilitation Team have been awesome. I appreciate their understanding and relentless support. I love the way the bootcamp has been structured and can see the importance of having to work through both the tech and core aspects of the program. Ultimately, I am responsible for what I achieve and my expectation of the team is simple – to keep up their good work!
