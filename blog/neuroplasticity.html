    <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
    <p>
      Neuroplasticity is a term that refers to the brain's ability to change and adapt as a result of experience. There are a lot of ways to increase neuroplasticity and use it to your advantage and here are a few taken from <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-brain-plasticity-2794886">Verywell Mind</a>
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Enriching Your Environment</strong> &#45; some examples are learning a new language, learning how to play an instrument, traveling, creating art, reading.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Getting plenty of rest</strong> &#45; practicing good sleep hygiene, developing a consistent sleep schedule and creating an environment that contributes to good sleep.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Exercising Regularly</strong> &#45; getting regular physical activity.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      This is another resource - <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/rewiring-your-brain#exercise">Healthline</a> &#45; in addition those listed above, this was at the top of their list.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Play video games</strong> &#45; improves motor coordination, visual recognition and spatial navigation, memory and reaction time, reasoning, decision making, and problem-solving skills.
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>The Growth Mindset</h2>
    <p>
      Mindset is a person&#39;s way of thinking, it&#39;s a set of beliefs that shape how you make sense of the world and yourself. Having a growth mindset means that your abilities can be developed over time through effort and persistence.
    </p>

    <p>
      I really loved how Carson Byblow shared his struggles of having a fixed mindset and how he beat it but most importantly how he recognises that we have to consistently work towards beating it - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px9CzSZsa0Y">The Mindset of a Champion</a>
    </p>

    <h2>My learning plan and strategies</h2>
    <p>
      I turned 40 a few months ago and have been doubting myself a little on whether a change in career at this stage in life is a sensible idea. Understanding neuroplasticity gives me the reassurance I need &#45; note to self: I am capable of learning web development and have the potential to be very good at it. It&#39;s great that I&#39;m halfway in as I already have the hunger to learn. It&#39;s maintaining a growth mindset that will always be a work in progress and it will be especially tougher when the workload increases or when the challenges get harder.
    </p>

    <p>
      The one thing that I usually take for granted is point 2 above &#45; getting plenty of rest. Taking multiple mini short breaks is definitely better than stopping when the sun has set 7 hours ago or when I can no longer feel my legs &#45; this is something I have proven but have yet to truly embrace.
    </p>

    <p>
      Speaking of “yet”, I&#39;ve learned that this is a very powerful three-letter word and didn&#39;t think much of it before. It&#39;s amazing how this word can shift the fixed mindset to the opposite direction. It&#39;ll be another tool to add into my toolbox!
