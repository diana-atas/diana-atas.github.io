      <p>
        <strong>Emotional intelligence</strong> is the ability to understand and manage your own emotions and feelings, and those of the people around you. <strong>Intelligence quotient (IQ)</strong>, on the other hand is a measure of one's reasoning ability, how well someone can use information and logic to answer questions or make predictions.
      </p>
      
      <p>Mac McElhaney in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoYr9H_56dE">TEDx Talk</a> - nailed the difference of the two, I quote: <em>“It's not always about who has the most smarts, sometimes it's about what you do with those smarts.”</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        There are five key elements to Emotional intelligence according to Daniel Goleman - a psychologist who helped popularise EI.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Self-awareness</strong> is knowing how you feel and how your emotions and your actions can affect the people around you. Being self-aware means recognising your strengths and limitations.</li>
        <li><strong>Self-regulation</strong> is all about staying in control, waiting for the right time and place to express your emotions, being accountable for your actions.</li>
        <li><strong>Empathy</strong> is the ability to put oneself in someone else's shoes, taking the time to understand someone else's situation.</li>
        <li><strong>Social skills</strong> entail the ability to interact well with others.</li>
        <li><strong>Motivation</strong> is about going beyond external rewards like money or recognition. Motivation is passion, fulfilling your inner needs, seeking for internal rewards, always looking for ways to do better.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Possessing strong emotional intelligence skills helps cultivate a positive mindset that allows you to thrive in whatever aspect in life and use your strengths to their full potential. Because these people have a profound understanding of their emotions and how they impact others, they can communicate better and handle awkward situations with grace, allowing people to build meaningful well-rounded relationships. The ask the right questions and inspire others to ask questions.
